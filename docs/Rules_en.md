# Linked.Coffee — Community Guidelines

##The basics
- This is a space for professional conversations, not transactions. Come to learn something new, share your experience, and meet interesting people.
- No selling. Your match is not a lead. If there's a genuine fit for collaboration, it will emerge naturally — but that's not why we're here.
- No recruiting. Unless your match explicitly asks for career opportunities, keep the job pitches out of the conversation.
- No dating. Linked.Coffee is a professional platform. There are better apps for that.
- Show up. If you said yes, be there. If something comes up, let your match know in advance. Ghosting ruins the experience for everyone.

## Making it great
- Listen as much as you talk. The best conversations are balanced. You're here to discover someone new, not to deliver a monologue.
- Stay curious. Your match might have a completely different background, industry, or worldview. That's the point. Approach differences with curiosity, not judgment.
- Skip the minefields. Politics, religion, and other divisive topics rarely lead anywhere good in a first conversation with a stranger. You're here to build bridges, not to debate.
- Respect time. If you agreed on 30 minutes, stick to it. If the conversation is flowing and both want to continue — great. But don't assume.
- Keep it confidential. What's shared in the conversation stays between you, unless you both agree otherwise.
