# 0. TL;DR (Short version)

- Linked.Coffee connects people from the tech world for friendly “random coffee” chats via Telegram.    
- You use the service through a Telegram bot. We don’t ask you for email to participate.
- We see what Telegram shows us (your Telegram ID, username, name, profile photo if available) and what you decide to tell the bot about yourself: interests, hobbies, professional background, career plans, and who you’d like to meet.
    
- We use this information only to:
    - match you with other people,
    - send you introductions and reminders,
    - keep the service running safely and improve it a bit over time.
    
- Your profile is only shown to people we match you with or to whom you explicitly allow it to be shown. We don’t sell your data and don’t spam you.
- Matching uses some simple “profiling” (we look at your interests and preferences to suggest people), but it does not make any decisions with big legal or financial impact.
- You can stop using the bot at any time and can ask us to delete your data or send you a copy of it.
- The service is run from Spain by Maxim Postnikov. GDPR applies, so you have all the usual privacy rights (access, correction, deletion, objection, etc.).
- If something is unclear or you want to use your data rights, you can contact us at m.postnikov@gmail.com or Telegram: @max_postnikov
