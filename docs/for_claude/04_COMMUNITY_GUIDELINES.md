# Linked.Coffee — Community Guidelines & Values

> **Purpose:** This document captures the community rules and cultural values so Claude can understand what kind of product we're building and what behaviors we want to encourage/discourage.

## Core Philosophy

Linked.Coffee is about **meaningful conversations, not transactions.**

We believe:

- The best opportunities come from people you don't know yet
- Genuine curiosity beats forced networking
- Diversity of perspectives creates value
- Respecting others' time is fundamental
- Professional growth happens through human connection

## Community Guidelines

### The Basics

| Rule                    | Why It Matters                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No selling**          | Your match is not a lead. Sales pitches destroy trust.  |
| **No recruiting**       | Unless explicitly asked, don't pitch jobs.              |
| **No dating**           | This is a professional platform.                        |
| **Show up**             | If you commit, be there. Ghosting ruins the experience. |
| **Let your match know** | If something comes up, notify in advance.               |

### Making It Great

| Guideline                      | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Listen as much as you talk** | Best conversations are balanced.                    |
| **Stay curious**               | Different backgrounds are the point, not a problem. |
| **Skip the minefields**        | Avoid politics, religion, divisive topics.          |
| **Respect time**               | Stick to agreed duration (30-50 mins).              |
| **Keep it confidential**       | What's shared stays between you.                    |

## Tone of Voice

When communicating with users (bot messages, emails, website):

| Attribute        | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Warm**         | Friendly but not overly casual              |
| **Professional** | Respectful of users' time and intelligence  |
| **Direct**       | Clear, concise, no fluff                    |
| **Encouraging**  | Celebrate participation, normalize skipping |
| **Humble**       | We're facilitators, not stars               |

Example: "Your match this week is..." (not "🎉🎉 AMAZING NEWS 🎉🎉")

## Handling Edge Cases

### No-Shows

- First offense: Gentle reminder about community guidelines
- Pattern: Temporary or permanent ban consideration

### Inappropriate Behavior

- Report mechanism (TODO)
- Review by admin
- Warning or ban depending on severity

### Mismatched Expectations

- Users can indicate "Coffee Goals" (Casual vs Professional)
- Users control Serendipity slider (similar vs diverse matches)
- Feedback loop helps improve matching over time
