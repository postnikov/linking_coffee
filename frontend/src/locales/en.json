Social media algorithms make it ever worse — showing us people just like ourselves. We end up in an echo chamber while fresh ideas and unexpected opportunities pass us by.",
            "p2": "Linked.Coffee's mission is to break down these walls. We connect tech professionals — developers, product managers, founders, executives, analysts — for \"random\" online coffee chats with people outside their usual circles. People you would never meet on your own. Who work in different industries, live in different countries, solve different problems — but speak the same language of technology and business.",
            "p3": "This isn't networking for the sake of collecting business cards. It's not sales disguised as introductions. Linked.Coffee is about honest conversations with no preset agenda. Sometimes a chat like this becomes the start of a partnership or friendship. Sometimes it simply expands your view of the world. And sometimes a random conversation partner gives you an insight in thirty minutes that would have taken you months to reach on your own.",
            "p4": "Smart matching considers your experience, interests, and goals to find conversation partners where the conversation will actually happen. Not randomness for its own sake, but meaningful pairings. Because the best career opportunities come from people you don't know yet. Linked.Coffee helps you meet them.",
